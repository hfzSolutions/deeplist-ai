# DeepList AI Transition Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the transition components built to help users understand the change from "AI Tools" to "AI Agents" terminology.

## Components Built

### 1. Announcement Banner (`AnnouncementBanner`)

- **Location**: Top of the page (integrated into `LayoutApp`)
- **Purpose**: Welcomes users to the new system and explains the terminology change
- **Features**:
  - Dismissible (stored in localStorage)
  - "Learn More" button opens migration guide
  - Beautiful gradient design with sparkle icon

### 2. Migration Guide Modal (`MigrationGuideModal`)

- **Trigger**: "Learn More" button in announcement banner
- **Purpose**: Detailed explanation of what's changed and what's new
- **Features**:
  - Simple, user-friendly messaging focused on key benefits
  - Lists 3 main new features (Chat History, Switch AI Mid-Chat, Everything in One Place)
  - Clear, benefit-focused descriptions
  - Encouraging "Ready to try?" call-to-action

### 3. Terminology Helper (`TerminologyHelper`)

- **Location**: Next to "Agents Store" title on homepage
- **Purpose**: Quick tooltip explaining what "Agents" means
- **Features**:
  - Small info icon with tooltip
  - Explains "Agents" = AI you chat with
  - Non-intrusive design

## How It Works
